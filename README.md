An interactive installation for the Astor Place Cube and the subway station beneath


## Pitch

Astor place is a hub of commuters, tourists, and lounging locals. Many memories are made here. Echoic memory vs iconic memory: Audio stays longer in short term memory. Want to connect the spaces of the cube and Astor Place with the subway station below.

Store the interesting sounds of Astor Place and play back for commuters in the subway station below

## Concept

1. Cube records interesting sounds from Astor Place over time
